The first, <b>Servant of Death</b>, is available in ebook and paperback format, and the second, <b>Ordeal by Fire</b>, is available in hardback, paperback and ebook. An audiobook will also be available soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Read the synopses and titles of future investigations in the&nbsp;Books&nbsp;section. You can read an extract from Servant of Death&nbsp;here, and the first chapter of Ordeal by Fire here.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bradecote and Catchpoll series are set in Worcestershire during the Anarchy of King Stephen’s reign, and commence in June 1143. They follow the investigations of Hugh Bradecote, a vassal lord of the Sheriff, William de Beauchamp, and the Sheriff’s Serjeant, the wily Catchpoll. Catchpoll is ‘the professional’, having been ‘serjeanting’ for twenty years. He knows nearly all the low life of Worcester, and works on the principle that outside of thefts for survival and crimes of passion, criminals are mean bastards, and the way to keep crime under control is to prove you are a meaner bastard than they are. He is observant, can think clearly, and is, above all, pragmatic. He has worked with an Under Sheriff who was not fluent in English, and was content to let Catchpoll do most of the work, and then present his findings to the Sheriff. This was perfectly acceptable to Catchpoll, who dislikes the idea of an interfering lord.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The first book, <b>Servant of Death</b>, sees the lord Sheriff of Worcestershire faced with with a murder in Pershore Abbey. He drafts in one of his vassals, Hugh Bradecote, as acting under-sheriff, expecting him to do no more than be emollient with the high ranking guests and abbot ,and&nbsp; with the instruction to ‘keep them sweet and let Catchpoll ferret’. Bradecote however, is no cipher, as Catchpoll discovers.\n</p><p><br></p><p>The second book, <b>Ordeal by Fire</b> takes place a couple of months after The Lord Bishop’s Clerk and finds Serjeant Catchpoll reluctantly calling in Under-Sheriff Hugh Bradecote when there is the suspicion of a fire-setter at large in Worcester. As readers of the first book will know, a grudging respect has grown between the wily and experienced serjeant and the new under-sheriff, but it is not a relationship without tensions, and these are exacerbated when the crimes are taking place in Catchpoll’s ‘home patch’. He knows Worcester inside out, and it touches his personal pride that he has no idea who is setting it aflame.\n</p><p><br></p><p>This book also introduces Walkelin, whom Catchpoll picks as his ‘serjeanting apprentice’. A red -haired young man of enthusiasm and dogged determination, his keenness may prove both an asset and a danger to himself.</p>",

I had the pleasure of meeting up with Matt in Worcester a few days ago 'to tread Catchpoll’s streets’, though alas the street plan is pretty much all bar the cathedral that  links modern Worcester to its 12thC incarnation.  <br><br>As an author, I consider a good unabridged audiobook even more pleasing than the thought of having one’s book transferred to the visual media, since this is the one chance to have the words one has crafted rendered into another medium without them having to be adulterated. It is not simply about them being read by a good voice, nor indeed by a good actor (since some outstanding actors are not exciting audiobook narrators), but a multi-layered skill involving both a wide vocal range and acting talent, pacing, clarity, and engagement both with the listener and the material itself. I am looking forward to February with eager anticipation and confidence.<br>",

The accessories of life change, and change massively, what was beyond knowledge can become commonplace; the food changes, the transport, the pace of life itself, but the historical murder mystery is about people, and people do not change.  The motivation for murder is pretty consistent through the centuries, which is why we can settle down with an historical murder mystery and not feel it is alien. In fact, it might even be described as ‘cosy’, since it distances us from the ‘nastiness’ of murder, cocooned as it is by the passage of time, and that distance sanitises it in a way that cannot apply to a contemporary crime novel.</p><p><br></p><p>People kill other people out of anger, lust, greed for power or things, revenge, fear, madness. They do that today in Birmingham and Budapest and Boston Massachusetts. They did that in twelfth century Worcestershire as well. They commit those murders in basically the same ways, using poison or strangulation, the good old ‘blunt instrument’ or the ‘killing weapon’ which is today a firearm and in the 12thC was a sword or a dagger. We have almost forgotten, in the age of CSI, that methods of detection relied almost entirely upon observation and experience for centuries, until first the fingerprint and now DNA analysis, took it to another level. Detectives, and yes, technically they did not ‘detect’ until the word was first used in the 15thC, used their senses and good sense. Of course, the fiction is in the depth of investigation. If you look even only as far back as the Elizabethan assizes documents you find that the crimes that came to court were the sort that today would be the ‘bread and butter’ murders that every police force meets regularly, the domestic, the killing in the execution of another crime, the brawl that gets out of hand. There were inquests, and the coroner’s jury decided if the death was misadventure, natural, felonious killing or murder. If the death was a criminal act then the suspected individuals were tried. (Incidentally, almost all cases of a wife killing her husband really were through poisoning, so gentlemen, you have been warned.) There is no sign that there was any convoluted method by which the person or persons who were accused had been discovered, and the ‘clear up rate’ was probably not one which a modern constabulary would accept. If you did not find out ‘who did it’ within a few days, then the chances were that you would never find out, unless the murderer committed that classic error of killing someone else. The more people you kill, the more likely you are to be caught, because connections appear. The investigation of murder, and indeed other crimes, is a mixture of science and an art. Catchpoll’s ‘Cwisker ruby and the cwee modo’, the ‘who, why, where, and how’, show that mix.  The science has moved on exponentially and gives the ‘where’ and ‘how’ to help reach the ‘who’ but the art, which is the analysis of ‘why’, getting into the mind of whoever did the act, seeking the reason, the motivation, is still down to looking at evidence and drawing conclusions. Just as murder is for the same basic reasons, the ‘art’ is about the same basic skills.</p><p><br></p><p>‘The past is the next village; they do things much the same there, but they have more old houses,’ is possibly more accurate, but not nearly so good or memorable a line as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._P._Hartley\" target=\"_blank\">L P Hartley’s</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

          "text": "<p>Ngaio Marsh ‘complained’ that Dorothy L Sayers was rather in love with her creation, Lord Peter Wimsey. One might argue that is a bit rich, when one looks at Marsh and Roderick Alleyn. Even if true for both, I do not think it detracts from their crime writing. Not that I conceal a hidden passion for Serjeant Catchpoll, though there is a lot to like in Hugh Bradecote. No, I am not enamoured of them, or the new member of the team, serjeanting-apprentice Walkelin. However I freely admit to a relationship with them, based upon familiarity and deep affection. This is obvious, one might say, when they originated in my own imagination, but in fact it is not automatic. In a later Bradecote and Catchpoll I have a psychopath, and I do not like him one little bit, however interesting he was to write.</p><p><br></p><p>As with all relationships, the one with my ‘boys’ (and how Catchpoll would laugh at that term applied to him) has developed over time. I have ‘known’ them for over a decade, not so much man and boy, but concept and fleshed out character, and the bond is strong. I had Catchpoll pretty much nailed from the first draft, because I had seen a black and white photograph in a newspaper of an actor about to play the lead role in an RSC production, and I looked at Serjeant Catchpoll staring at me from the page. It was instant recognition, and when I added that to the character developing in my head, he could be said to have arrived fully formed. Yet even with him, I found situations where I realised he would think not as I would have expected. His initial relationship with the new undersheriff, Hugh Bradecote, was wary, even antagonistic, but has grown to be a close bond of respect and even friendship, though he would deny it in public. As for me, Hugh Bradecote was initially rather a shadowy figure at first draft, a bit ‘thin’, and he only filled out when I saw an actor of his rough physical description who had nuances of manner and voice that I could ‘adopt’ for my underdeveloped undersheriff. I gave him the stride, the voice, the mobile brows, the way he rubbed his chin when perplexed. From that I could invest a lot more in Bradecote, and the words flowed in consequence. The later drafts of the first book in the series, The Lord Bishop’s Clerk, were a good ten thousand words longer than the first one, not simply because of the character himself but how that impacted upon the plot.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came to write Ordeal By Fire, I had a head start, since I knew a lot about both men. and I discovered more, especially about Catchpoll, because I was writing him on his ‘own patch’ and in his own home, with old friends, old enemies, and a wife of many years. As I wrote I discovered, not by intent, but almost by an osmotic process, how Bradecote and Catchpoll were adapting to each other. This came largely from the dialogue between the two, and dialogue is a fluid thing. Whilst one has the aim of what needs to be conveyed for the plot advancement, how that is achieved is in no way formulaic. I let them speak for themselves, make the adjustments to how they interacted, and felt more a reporter than puppeteer. Gradually, Bradecote and Catchpoll were developing an off page reality, so that I might think of them in the same way that I might think of a pen friend not yet met face to face, or in the modern communication world, someone with whom one exchanges frequent social emails. When is someone real? Being corporeal is only a part of it. By the time Ordeal By Fire was complete I could not wait to ‘work with’ the pair, and their new colleague Walkelin, on another murder. What happened next is jumping the gun, and I will not spoil the plot by revealing it now, but it brought a new dynamic to the relationships, and has had consequences thereafter. I have now reached the point where, if I do not have a plot within which to work with ‘the boys’, I really miss them. I am currently working up the eighth Bradecote and Catchpoll murder mystery, and do not know how many there will be in the end, other than that there will be an end, and my heart will be more than a little broken to part from them.</p><p><br></p><p>I said I am not in love with my detectives. Perhaps that is a lie to self, because I do love them, just not romantically.</p>"

          "text": "<p>I wanted to stress the integration of my ‘minor’ manorial lord. I decided that his grandfather came from Normandy, but he was not going to inherit much as one of five sons. Coming over with Urse d’Abitot in 1069, he was given Bradecote and a couple of smaller holdings as Urse’s vassal. He married the daughter of a local thane, and was succeeded by the one son who survived infancy, Richard of Bradecote. Writing ‘of’ all the time, just as saying it, becomes a chore, and so grandson Hugh is simply Hugh Bradecote. He is proud of his Norman lineage, not least because it defines his status in society, but the soil he would die to defend, ‘his lands’, are English, and he has never been further than Winchester, let alone across the Channel. He does not put a name to what he is, but perhaps the closest in his mind would be ‘a Norman Englishman’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With regard to how Hugh Bradecote’s name is said, as long as the stress is on the first syllable and both the ‘a’ and ‘o’ are short vowels, you are not far wrong. It is not said Braid-coat. I call him Brad-(uh)- cot, but, since I say it quite a lot, that actually contracts to Brad-c’t.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>When I created him in the very first draft of Servant of Death my mental image of Hugh Bradecote’s physicality was a little vague beyond dark haired, tall, and inclined to the lean. I then saw someone with those attributes who gave me a more defined image in my head, and I went back and gave him pretty much those features, and some of the mannerisms.&nbsp;</p>"

He is defined by what he is, and I think he likes it that way. The word ‘Catchpoll’ exists in Old English and Old French and was certainly applied to a sheriff’s officer in Middle English, so it was logical enough to give him that ‘job’ name. This means of course that he does, or did, have another name at birth, but my thought is that whatever it was he disliked it, and once he became the Sheriff’s Serjeant he ensured it was not used. He likes the fact that just the one word of his name makes the ne’er-do-wells of Worcester slink back into the shadows.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;\">Unlike Bradecote, Catchpoll has a physical image that is entirely one man. I saw a black and white photograph with a newspaper interview at the time of first writing and it was instantly as if I was looking at just the character I wanted, down to the grizzled stubble and the thin lips. His manner and his mentality came from elsewhere, but I still have a copy of that photograph. I prefer to let readers conjure up their own imagined image of characters, but Catchpoll might prove the exception. Perhaps one day, and if the unsuspecting ‘original’ permitted, I might reveal how Catchpoll ‘really’ looks. &nbsp;</span></p>"

I do continue to use only places that are mentioned in it, but have changed to the modern spellings. In some ways it looks anachronistic, but it does mean that readers can follow the investigations when the characters trot about the countryside, and it gives a good sense of ‘geography’, even if it lessens the ‘history’. The other aspect is that spelling has wandered all over the place over the centuries, and Domesday itself was a rendition by a scribe of what the places were called by those living there at the time. Picking a consistent snapshot other than Domesday would have been very tricky indeed.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two very notable exceptions to my modern spelling rule. The first is that Droitwich was called  Wich until the 14th C, and that was too obvious a great and late change to keep.</p><p><br></p><p>The second is Bradecote itself. The modern spelling is Bredicot, which shows how it has morphed over the centuries from the Bradecote of Domesday, via Bradicot, Bradecot and Brodecot in the 14th C.  Hugh Bradecote is. of course. my invention, and in reality Bradecote was held by the Poer family from the Bishop of Worcester.&nbsp;</p>"

Over the centuries it waxed and waned. Three hundred years later it was refounded during the great revival of English monasticism under the aegis of Dunstan, Aethelwold and Oswald, adopted the Rule of St Benedict, and remained an abbey of the Benedictines until its dissolution in 1540. The Saxon church burnt down in 1002, and its replacement was completed in 1020. It stood for only seventy years before being superseded by the Norman building, the south transept and crossing piers of which remain today, although that in turn suffered from fire in 1102. Fire destroyed the quire in 1223, which resulted in much rebuilding in the Early English style. Yet another fire, in 1290, spread from the monks’ bakehouse, brought down part of the tower through the quire roof vault, and also caused destruction among the houses of the town. The new tower was in the Decorated style.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>When the Dissolution of the Monasteries occurred during the reign of Henry VIII, most of the claustral buildings were demolished, and the materials sold off. However, the townsfolk bought the quire end to be their parish church. This was quite unusual, since it was more common for the local populace to buy the nave, where they would have been permitted to attend services over the centuries, rather than see that pulled down. The north transept part of the remaining building collapsed in 1686 and was not replaced.</p><p><br></p><p>Pershore’s history of suffering damaging fires gave me the idea for the more minor fire damage, from a lightning strike, that means the masons are at work upon the church building during <b>Servant of Death</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>Excavations at Pershore took place in the late1920s, when much of the cloister and its ranges were unearthed, and there were further excavations in the mid 1990s, preceding the laying of underfloor heating in the church. These excavations discovered the Saxon foundations.&nbsp;</p>"

          "text": "<p>At the time of refoundation Pershore Abbey was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saints Peter and Paul, but the two apostles were replaced by St Eadburga after the translation of most of her relics there. It was far from wealthy, since much of its land was given to the ‘new’ Westminster Abbey in the years either side of the Conquest in 1066. It had already lost land following the 1002 fire, when it had been rendered uninhabitable for a time, and other parts had been taken by the avaricious Earl Aelfhere. There was a brief revival of fortune in the early 1050s when Earl Odda  restored some of its lands. Odda is sometimes named as Aelfhere’s son, but perhaps was more probably son of the Aethelweard who had been instrumental in the refoundation of Pershore as a Benedictine House. This would account for Odda being such a benefactor to Pershore, and also for the fact that that both he and his brother were buried there.  He was recorded as a pious man, who took the cowl towards the end of his life.  Odda’s piety remains in the visible form of Odda’s Chapel at Deerhurst, which is a notable Anglo-Saxon building. He had it erected in memory of his brother. Earl Odda died at Deerhurst but was buried in the Lady Chapel of Pershore Abbey. In some accounts it is this Earl Odda who purchased the relics of St Eadburga from the Nunnaminster in Winchester, where she had lived and died.  There is, however,  circumstantial evidence that it might have been Aethelweard who  oversaw the translation at the time of the refoundation. The 1002 fire destroyed nearly all Pershore’s old documents, which does not help matters. There is an entire chapter devoted to the cult of St Eadburga at Winchester and Pershore in The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England: A Study of West Saxon and East Anglian Cults (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Fourth Series) by Susan J Ridyard (CUP 1989). It makes interesting reading, but shows just how little can be pinned down as fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Eadburga’s life was set down in the Vita Edburge by Osbert of Clare in the 12th C, by which time the monks of Pershore would have a well told story of how they obtained the saintly relics. . This Life says that  at the age of three the infant princess entered the Nunnaminster, a house of nuns founded by her grandmother Aethelswith, wife of Alfred the Great.  She died there some time between 950AD - 960AD and was swiftly venerated and beatified. She was renowned for her humility and piety in life, but the tale of how her body was moved several times, at her spirit’s instigation, is in marked contrast. She was at first buried outside the church, but a sister charged with closing the window that was situated near her grave found herself unable to close the window because of an unseen pressure, on several occasions. The nuns took this as a divine sign and reburied Eadburga in the church, but outside the choir. Eadburga’s spirit then appeared to the sisters and indicated she ought to be buried by the high altar. In the face of this otherworldly instruction, the nuns did just as they were told, and moved the royal nun to her desired resting place. Around the 970s, under the auspices of Bishop (later Saint) Aethelwold, and during the monastic reform led by him, Dunstan and Oswald, she was moved once more into a silver and gem encrusted shrine. Osbert says that the Abbess of the Nunnaminster sold the skull, and a major part of the other remains of St Eadburga to Earl Aethelweard (comes Alwardus)   at some point in the 970s. The saint was apparently none too pleased about this, and only when sisters of the Nunnaminster walked barefoot to Pershore and prayed for the saint’s forgiveness, did miracles once more occur in Winchester. The abbess was certainly not popular for selling the major part of her abbey’s only saint. Ridyard suggests that in favour of this being the date of the removal of the saint to Pershore is that the division of saintly relics often took place at times of reinterment, as happened with the move to the ornate shrine in the 970s, and the fact that the first abbot of Pershore when it was refounded was Fordbriht, a disciple of St Aethelwold. On the other hand, the translation of the bones may not have occurred until the time of Earl Odda, or they might even have been ‘purloined’.  She also raises the possibility of some confusion with the Mercian saintly princess, St Eadburga of Aylesbury, and the Dictionary of National Biography also suggests other Eadburgas.  There is St Eadburga of Repton, (died early 700s AD) daughter of King Aldwulf of East Anglia, St Eadburga of  Minster, Thanet, (died about 751AD) daughter of King Centwine of Kent, St Eadburga of Aylesbury (died about AD 650) daughter of Ceolric, King of Wessex, St Eadburga of Bicester ( died about 680AD) daughter of Penda, King of Mercia), and St Eadburga of Deira ( died about 725AD), daughter of Alcfrith, King of Deira. It all gets very murky. However, the version that has lasted over the centuries is that Pershore obtained the relics of St Eadburga of Winchester, and for the purposes of <b>Servant of Death</b>, that is the case. &nbsp;</p>"

          "text": "<p>A  Benedictine monastery was quite ordered, both by the Offices of the Day, the services that all monks attended, and by the structure of the hierarchy within it. Firstly, there were ‘choir monks’ and ‘lay brothers’. Choir monks, as the name implies, sat within the choir, nearer the high altar, and sang the Offices in Latin. The Benedictines followed the concept of ‘laborare est orare’ - ‘to work is to pray’, and all the monks were expected to work for certain periods of the day. However, the lettered choir monks worked in the scriptorium rather than labouring every day in the fields, or with the fish ponds. From among the choir monks came also the obedientaries of the monastery, those with specific roles and duties for the running of the House. Some of these duties were purely administrative, and others had practical aspects.</p><p><br></p><p>An abbey was headed by an <b>abbot</b> or <b>abbess</b>, and a priory by a <b>prior</b> or <b>prioress</b>. A large monastic institution might have not only a prior under the abbot as ‘second in command’, but also a <b>sub-prior</b>. They dealt with the overall day to day running of the enclave, especially if the abbot was involved in wider issues within the Church or state. An abbot was involved in politics, however much a monastery was set apart from the secular world, not least because monasteries held large estates, and the Church wielded a lot of power.</p><p><br></p><p>There were then the obedientaries with specific areas of responsibility.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Precentor</b> - was in charge of both the liturgical and the literary aspects of the monastery, and during the 12th century the latter became more important. Initially he would have led the choir and organised the choral part of the services, but not those involving the altar. He also ran the writing and illumination that took place in the scriptorium, and might make the decisions on which books would be copied, if the abbot did not think himself qualified, or had too little time to make such decisions. It was a position taken by some of the most literary men, such as William of Malmesbury, and Eadmer.</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Sacrist</b> - was in charge of the altars and service at them, the vestments and plate, and the decoration and repair of the church building, a de facto Clerk of Works, although in some cases an actual Clerk of Works was designated under them.</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Cellarer</b>- was in charge of the food and drink for both monks and guests in a managerial capacity, but under him there would be perhaps a kitchener who ran the kitchen but did not cook, a refectorer in charge of the refectory and all that was in it, from rushes for the floor, lamps and linen, and a pittancer, in charge of the additional dishes for feast days.</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Infirmarian</b> or <b>Infirmarer</b> - almost ran a monastery within a monastery, since he ran an establishment set apart from the main day to day life of the enclave. The sick, and also those infirm through age, were in his care, and all monks were bled upon a rotation during the year, requiring different meals and a different regimen. He therefore had his own refectory and kitchen, chapel and even garden, and arranged for  his ‘sub flock’ to receive Mass and the sacraments.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>Novices</b> - was, perfectly logically, in charge of those in the novitiate, aspiring to take vows. There would generally be also a Master of the Children where youngsters were effectively given an education by the monks, but were not automatically destined for the cowl.</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Almoner</b> - dispensed charity in the form of food and clothing, or a bed for the night, to applicants, some of whom would be regular.</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Guest</b> <b>Master</b> or <b>Hosteler</b> - in the twelfth century there were no hotels. Inns, which gave lodging, were rare, ale-houses and taverns were places to drink. If one had to travel about the country one stayed with relatives if possible, and more frequently in the Guest Hall of a monastery, which gave a place of safety, food and lodging. It was expected that one would pay according to one’s wealth for this hospitality, and no doubt some guests paid in kind rather than in coin. The vast majority of people, the peasantry, would never go further from their village than they could reach and still return before nightfall. Townsfolk who traded beyond what was brought into the town for market might have need to go further afield, and so some of the travellers using the Guest Halls were guildsmen, and women, engaged in trade. There would also be pilgrims, seeking the aid of some local saint, or making their way on the long and arduous treks to visit shrines of international renown. The third group of travellers would be lordly, and might arrive with an impressive entourage, or be accompanied by just a servant or small escort of men-at-arms. Ladies would not travel unprotected. The Guest Master had to see that the rooms were ready for guests, liaise with them, and arrange for the stabling and even shoeing, of their horses.</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Chamberlain</b> was in charge of clothing, from habits and cloaks to boots and shoes, bedding and the baths.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

          "text": "<p>Hugh Bradecote speaks Norman French among those of his own social class, and language was very much a mark of class at this time. However, he has learned English (Old English/early Middle English) from childhood, since his nurse would have been English, and if a manorial lord could not understand what his peasants said, nor give them his command, it weakened the bond between them and made it more likely that they would cheat him in little ways. Tenants-in-chief with lands across the Channel, and interests at the Norman French speaking court, would not deign to use it, but for Bradecote it is a vital tool. Thus, most of the conversations that take place in the stories would have been in English, with a few in Norman French, which Catchpoll has picked up enough to follow, having worked in the castle and for the Sheriff for so long. Old English looks more alien to the modern eye than it sounds to our ear, and although spellings have changed over the millennium, about one third of the language we use today is basically what we used then. The Normans gave us words in government, in law, and the ‘finer’ things, the cooked meats of beef and pork and mutton for example, but it never replaced English, merely added a new layer to be assimilated. I am one of those who thinks that the Scandinavian languages in the Danelaw were more significant in the long term, since they not only added vocabulary but also had significant effects on the way our grammar altered, especially in the area of inflexions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Middle English is generally accepted as commencing from the early 12th century. Much of what survives of Old English is in the West Saxon dialect, which came to dominate as Wessex itself became the centre of kingship and governance in Anglo-Saxon England. However, after the Conquest it appears scribes were writing in a way that reflected how their local dialect had developed, with more Scandinavian words in the Danelaw. Some Latin had become assimilated in areas such as things to do with church and religion, and there were already some Norman French words such as ‘tresor’. Moreover, the word endings and inflexions that had been clear in the Wessex of Alfred were blurring. The Peterborough Chronicle, which has useful information on the reign of King Stephen, clearly shows that English had moved on from, for example, Beowulf.</p><p><br></p><p>Even without study, the gist of much of what is written in the Peterborough Chronicle can be understood. As an example -</p>"

          "text": "In the twelfth century the majority of people in England lived in dwellings that were a single chamber with a central hearth, low eaves, and shuttered openings for windows. Life indoors was not light and airy, but then a lot of the day was spent in the open air, working the land. Even the inhabitants of towns were not enclosed; butchers butchered and tanners tanned in the open air, and craftsmen had large shuttered frontages to their workshop homes, both for light to work and access for customers to see their wares. Nearly all the domestic architecture of the period is long gone, or so transformed as to be unrecognisable, so what we see are castles and ecclesiastical buildings, edifices in stone. Many castles are ruins, most churches have undergone change as they have been enlarged and ‘upgraded’ over the centuries, and nearly all are shades of grey (not fifty thereof) or sandstone pinks and reds. If we enter a church with Norman elements still visible, we are impressed by the carving of arch, the curve of barrel vaulting or massive round piers, and do not usually think beyond shape and scale. It is difficult to imagine that such buildings were also brightly decorated. This world, they announced, might be gloomy, but Heaven was bright, the Church was the link to Heaven and obedience the path to eventually reaching the light. Once walls began to be plastered, it was possible to decorate pictorially, as well as adding colour to the geometric carvings and to those great piers, which were often decorated in chevron form. The colours used were earth based ochres in the main, so shades of reds and terracottas, yellow and mustard/cream. Thus a church, and even more so a cathedral, was unlike the everyday world, but a glimpse towards the world to come. ",

          "text": "Patterns were eye-catching, but in a largely illiterate world, then paintings educated, informed, and also warned. It therefore became popular to show the congregation not only scenes from scripture, but the perils of sin, and the blessings of virtue. Such depictions became ever more graphic in what would happen to the sinner at the Day of Judgment. (This is where one needs to remember that ‘Doom’ comes from ‘dom’ the Old English for ‘judgment’, hence Domesday book.) These paintings developed through the mediaeval period until the Reformation, and were then destroyed or whitewashed over, to be rediscovered centuries later. We may never know exactly how prevalent they were. Of course they cost money, so churches with wealthy (or perhaps guilt-ridden) patrons would be more likely to possess the best paintings.",

Now redundant, it is cared for by English Heritage, and entrance is free. It is in Gloucestershire, but within a few miles of Bradecote &amp; Catchpoll’s own stamping ground, and is predominantly of their period, built about 1120/1130, with a tower added in the thirteenth century. The small west door, now leading into the tower rather than the outside, has been dendrochronologically dated to being of wood felled between 1114 and 1144, and the construction method is such that the experts believe the main south door to be of the same period, so you can actually open a door that Bradecote or Catchpoll might have opened.&nbsp;<br>",

          "text": "<p>The nave is still the same simple aisle-less shape, but has undergone more changes than the chancel, with later window additions. This means most of the wall painting in the nave is a little later, with the exception of the chancel wall. However, it is thought that originally the Romanesque wall paintings did continue further in the space where the congregation would stand. It is when one enters the chancel, which would be the preserve of the priest, and where laity might only glimpse its glories on very special occasions, except through a screen, that the full magnificence of the twelfth century paintings can be seen. The low barrel vault and the walls are all decorated, and their colours, even though probably the base paintings and lacking much of the fine detail, are clear and quite bright. Christ sits in judgment, with the twelve apostles on the walls at either side. There is a depiction of the New Jerusalem above a window, and images of bishops and pilgrims that may well represent the consecration of the church and its benefactor. Unlike later Judgment paintings, the fate of the sinful, being tossed into the Eternal Flames, is absent. When these paintings were fresh, how bright they must have been, and how they must have drawn the eye, and focused the mind also. Even when window embrasures were small, the plastered walls would reflect the candlelight upon the images. The red and yellow ochres are much in evidence but, in addition, Kempley has the earliest use in England of blue azurite in the pigments. This was a very expensive pigment, which shows that a wealthy patron paid for the artwork. The manor belonged to the de Lacys, an important baronial family who originated in Lassy, Normandy, and this shows their wealth and power, as well as religious devotion, (endowing churches and monastic institutions was considered very beneficial for the soul).</p><p><br></p><p>So I commend this tiny mediaeval gem to any who can go and see it, not only for its history, and indeed its charm, but because within its walls I feel Bradecote and Catchpoll are even more ‘real’, and you can see life was not as drab as you might think.</p>"

'Let us not creep towards what you seek. It was I who found the corpse, my lord, so it is what you want to know about. I admit that it fair took me aback for a moment or so, and then I came out into the cloister, where Abbot William was leading the brothers to Compline, and told what I'd found.'</p><p>'What exactly were you doing in the workshop, Master Elias? Your men had gone into the town, yes?'</p><p>The master mason was quite prepared for the question, and answered promptly enough.</p><p>'Aye, my lord. I gave them an hour or so off, but it has always been my way to check the workshop. I am a good master, any will say that, but I demand high standards from my masons, in the craft and in how they leave the workshop each night. Good job I did look too, because it wasn't left as I would want, not by a long way.'</p><p>'In what way did it fail?' Bradecote shot a quick glance at Catchpoll.</p><p>'Well, the floor hadn't been swept properly, nor the bench cleaned. I don't accept dust all about the workshop. Untidiness in the little things leads to untidiness with chisel and mallet, and that is both wasteful of time and stone, and dangerous to limb and eye. What was worse, there was even a mallet left out on the bench, not in the rack, and the men know how I expect all the tools accounted for. Mind you, I gave Arnulf the back of my hand when he returned. He was the apprentice given the tidying task last night, and his mind was on what was to come, not what was to be done. You can understand why I don’t give them time off, regular.'</p><p>The Sheriff's men tried not to appear too interested in this information, and Catchpoll said nonchalantly, 'I would not have thought you were a master who was often disobeyed, Master Elias.'</p><p>The master mason puffed himself up importantly, and thrust his chin forward in an effort to emphasise his unassailable authority. 'No indeed. My men rarely act foolish.' He added fairly, 'Unless of course they've taken drink, and we all know that when the drink is in, the sense goes out.' His expression became very serious. 'I let them off of an occasional evening, because they are not permitted to drink ale when working, just small beer. Chisels are sharp, ladders are tall, and dying too easy. I have seen it often enough over the years, the waste of a good man through a moment of thoughtlessness.'</p><p>'So it was unusual for the apprentice to leave things out of place?' Bradecote interrupted what could become a list of the dangers facing masons. He could see what Catchpoll was trying to ascertain.</p><p>Master Elias furrowed his brow. 'Most unusual.'</p><p>Hugh Bradecote made a mental note to visit the masons' workshop, and cast about in a new direction.</p><p>'You are a craftsman of some note, Master Elias. Abbot William told me you had come here with recommendations from Ely, Oxford and Abingdon. In your wide travels, had you come into contact with Eudo the Clerk before?'</p><p>The master mason shook his head. He had been expecting to be asked about the man, and it posed no problem, although he would be glad enough to set the conversation in another direction.</p><p>'I have worked in many places, but I have no cause to speak with the brethren, other than those obedientaries concerned with the fabric of their buildings, and of course the head of the house.' He spoke no less than the truth, and he had not actually been asked if he had merely seen Eudo before.</p><p>'You have not been to Romsey? The two nuns are from there.'</p><p>'I have not. I prefer not to work in a house of women.' He grimaced. 'My father, who was a master mason before me, did so once, and complained ever after. Trouble, they are. They change their minds, see, enough to drive a sane man mad. You get half way through a design and then they think of something they want changing, as though you could add to stone as well as take away.'</p><p>Catchpoll nodded in fellow feeling.</p><p>Bradecote returned to more pertinent matters. 'How was it that you decided, yesterday evening, to give the men time in the town when you admit that you do so only rarely?'</p><p>'It had been a hot day, my lord, both in the confines of the workshop and up on the north transept. The heat takes it out of the men, and frays tempers, which leads to mistakes, and you cannot afford that up top, or with expensive stone. That it happened to be the evening of a death is but chance, aye, and mischance for me if it leads to you suspecting me of wrong-doing.' The master mason sounded suitably aggrieved at the possible doubting of his honesty.</p><p>'Could you tell us exactly what happened, and what you found, as you did to the lord abbot.' It was an instruction rather than a question. Bradecote was not going to follow up the last answer by assuring the man that he was not suspected.</p><p>'Aye, my lord. It was simple enough. I was in the workshop, after supper, between Vespers and Compline, checking things over and considering a new design. There was a natural fault in the latest block and I would rather use it than discard the stone.' His voice warmed briefly with the enthusiasm of a man who loves his work. 'There's great satisfaction to be had, getting the best from a piece, especially when nature brings out a problem to be overcome.'</p><p>'Indeed. But to continue?'</p><p>'Well, eventually I came up with a solution and, since it had to be close to Compline, I left the workshop. I had thought to take my place early in the nave. As I reached the crossing I turned first to the altar, as you would, and saw the cowled penitent before it. I would have passed on without disturbing him if it had not been for the fly?'</p><p>'The fly?' Catchpoll looked puzzled.</p><p>'Aye, a fly was buzzing round his head, and even a man at prayer won't suffer a fly on his pate without even a twitch. It was just odd, that's all, not natural. Then I got this feeling something wasn't right. I couldn't say what, just not right, so I drew closer, and that's when I saw his head had been stove in. Terrible it was, enough to turn a man’s stomach.'</p><p>'But not yours,’  Bradecote noted.</p><p>'Well, I’ll not say I didn’t feel my gorge rise, my lord, for I did, but . . .look, I’ve been a mason all my adult life, apprentice to master, and it is a craft with its dangers. I’ve seen what a man looks like after falling from eighty feet, or more, and often enough not to want to gawp. Still, this was nasty . . . '</p><p>&nbsp;The master mason shook his head, more in disapproval than shock, thought Catchpoll.</p><p>'What did you make of the burnt documents, Master Elias?' Bradecote had not finished. He made the question sound casual.</p><p>&nbsp;'Didn't make anything at all, my lord,' responded Elias, looking blankly at him. 'I was just concerned at having found a dead man in the church. Aye, and one who could not have taken his own life. The man who did it could have been close by, so I had no wish to linger. That would be a foolish thing, even though I would say I was a man who could take care of himself. I headed straight out as the Compline bell rang.'</p><p>'Did you see or hear anyone else in the church while you were there?'</p><p>This was easier. 'No, my lord. But it's not likely I would have heard anyone while I was in the workshop.' He paused. 'There now, I almost forgot. There was someone, someone in St Eadburga's Chapel when I came in. I couldn't say who, but I could hear whispering, like one at prayer. Perhaps that was that Clerk, before he was killed.' He smiled at Bradecote as if expecting recognition for his feat of memory.</p><p>The acting under-sheriff did not smile, but nodded an acknowledgment. 'Is there anything else you think might be useful?' Bradecote had no expectation of a reply and was surprised at the master mason's answer.</p><p>'Well, nothing directly so, my lord, but I was thinking that if you wanted to know more about the dead man you might try asking Brother Remigius, the sub-prior here. He used to be at Winchester, see, and yesterday, while I was speaking with him, the lord bishop’s clerk approached and spoke to him. What he said was none of my concern, and I did not pry, but I tell you true, Brother Remigius looked about as happy as a man who's had a fox in his coop.'</p><p>'Thank you, Master Elias, for your help. You may return to your labours.'</p><p>The big man stood up from the bench, looked from Catchpoll to Bradecote and made for the door. As he reached it, Bradecote halted him with a final question, thrown as an afterthought.</p><p>'Your work must involve much calculation and planning. I take it you are a lettered man?'</p><p>Elias smiled proudly. 'That I am, my lord. Taught to read by the brothers in St Edmondsbury when I was a lad. My mother, God rest her, thought I would take the cowl,' he chuckled, 'but I was more interested in the building than the life of contemplation. Not for me, the tonsure.' He left, looking cheerful.</p><p>'What do you think then, Catchpoll? Would a man like that seek to avoid a possible threat, or would he have been intrigued enough to see if any of the vellum was readable?'</p><p>Catchpoll sneered. 'He wasn't afraid of anyone else being present, not him. I don't see him being perturbed at the thought, just alert. Not the ‘simple’ soul he would have us believe, is Master Elias, and observant too. His work means he looks carefully. If anything was still to be seen, he would have seen it.'</p><p>'Or been the one to set it aflame.'</p><p>'Oh, aye. The person who ”discovers” the victim must be the killer, my lord?' Catchpoll shrugged. 'It is certainly common enough, but you have to watch what is common.'</p><p>'Perhaps, though, he could be one without the other.' Bradecote ignored the implied criticism.</p><p>Catchpoll was dismissive. 'If he read what was there, but was not the killer, it would be a strange coincidence if it turned out to be something he would wish to destroy.'</p><p>Bradecote agreed. He realised, with no little surprise, that he was suddenly becoming unnaturally suspicious, and, Heaven help him, like the serjeant.</p><p>'He could still be our man. We know of no motive, but he was in the right place, and is easily strong enough to have dragged the body.'</p><p>'So do we ferret around in the masons' workshop or work through the list of unaccounted for brethren, my lord?'</p><p>The younger man ran his long fingers through his dark hair, and sighed. 'I have no doubt everything is now as it should be there, and nothing of significance will remain, but yes, we ferret, Catchpoll. And we pray for a sign.' He pulled a wry face.</p><p>'Not a sign,' muttered Catchpoll, under his breath. 'Priests wants signs. I wants evidence.'</p><p><br></p><p><b>Copyright Sarah Hawkswood 2015</b></p>"

          "text": "<p><b>Copyright Sarah Hawkswood 2015</b></p><p><br></p><p>September 1143</p><p><br></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p><br></p><p>'Fire!'</p><p>The cry spread almost as swiftly as the flames, from person to person as from straw to straw of the crackling thatch.</p><p>'Fire!'</p><p>Panic was mixed with action as anxious mothers dragged wide-eyed children from the spectacle. Neighbours, with as much an eye to preventing the blaze reaching their own property as to aiding the unfortunate silversmith whose workshop was alight, came running with buckets and pitchers to take water from the nearest well, and poles and hooks to pull down the burning thatch.</p><p>Serjeant Catchpoll was on his way back to the castle after visiting one of the burgesses. He had been sent by the sheriff to report the successful apprehension of the thief who had stolen the good man's three best pullets. It was a call of courtesy, and Catchpoll, who was not a naturally courteous man, was not best pleased, but William de Beauchamp, lord Sheriff of Worcestershire, was himself far too important to make such a visit. Instead, he had delegated his serjeant so that the next meeting of the burgesses would not lead to their whining petition for greater diligence in upholding the king’s laws by the sheriff and his men.</p><p>The serjeant halted, making a swift assessment of the situation. Fire was the great fear of townsfolk, with their homes and businesses cheek by jowl, and nearly every one of them constructed of wood, and daub, and thatch. A fire that Catchpoll could remember from his youth, back in 1113, had cost dozens of lives, and livelihoods too. One of his own cousins had perished then, and there had been fire both accidental and intentional in the last dozen years.&nbsp;</p><p>He considered running to the castle to bring the men-at-arms to assist, but it was clear that the alarm had been raised swiftly and it was a windless afternoon. Running was not something he did from choice at his age. The inhabitants of the street had pulled down the little thatched lean-to abutting the neighbouring premises, disregarding the pleas of the owner, and had created a small fire break. Women were throwing water at the wall of this adjacent property, and already the smoke was more in evidence than the flames.</p><p>Catchpoll pulled a face. He could, as the sheriff's officer, make his presence known and take charge of the scene. On the other hand, the locals were doing pretty well on their own, and if the fire were not sufficiently damped down and erupted again later there could be no blame laid at his door. He held back and waited, inconspicuously; he was a man who could merge into the background when occasion arose. Eventually the number of people in the street began to thin, leaving only the tradesman and his immediate neighbours surveying the scene. Puddles of sooty water lay in every depression of the trampled earth of the narrow street, and the scattered thatch was strewn as if thrown randomly by a giant hand. Charred beams pointed accusing black fingers heavenward, and the frame of the lean-to stood precariously at a drunken angle. The owner of the structure was still complaining vociferously, but nobody was paying him any attention whatsoever.&nbsp;</p><p>Serjeant Catchpoll took a deep breath, and promptly coughed as the ghost of an acrid tendril of smoke caught in his throat. He had hoped to step forward looking official, but found himself being thumped on the back by an elderly and sparsely toothed woman, and attracting the attention of the sorry-looking party while bent double and with streaming eyes.</p><p>The diversion caused the lean-to's owner to cease his complaint. After a minute, Catchpoll stood upright again. He hawked, paused and spat into the soot-flecked dust.</p><p>'You know me. I am the lord sheriff's man, and he will want to know of this. How did the fire start?' he asked, still wheezing slightly.&nbsp;</p><p>'How do you think?' demanded the lean-to owner, grumpily. 'You'd think any man with a furnace in his premises would keep a better eye on it, not risk his neighbours through negligence.'</p><p>''Twas not negligence, as I and my journeyman could tell you if you would but listen.'</p><p>The silversmith, sitting on an upturned tun, wringing his hands, roused himself from his gloom, and the journeyman, who had been having a burned hand tended by a winsome maid who had eased his discomfort as much by her presence as her ministrations, looked round to confirm his master's words.&nbsp;</p><p>'True enough. The fire did not start by the furnace, and it was banked down low this afternoon. Master Reginald was selecting stones for setting in a chalice, and I was polishing. The fire was in the thatch at the rear of the shop when we first noticed it.'</p><p>Serjeant Catchpoll frowned. A fire was bad, but a deliberate fire was far worse.</p><p>'Don't you take what that longshanks says as truth,' piped up the old woman who had clapped Catchpoll on the back. 'He'd swear sunrise was sunset to keep in his master's favour. He'll not have the wherewithal to wed else, and he can't afford to wait long. She,' and the woman pointed a dirty-nailed finger at the journeyman's ministering angel, 'won't be able to hide the result of their sinning 'neath her gown much longer.'</p><p>The young woman reddened and threw the woman a fulminating glance, but the old woman merely laughed mirthlessly. Catchpoll's eyes, like everyone else's, dwelt upon the girl's figure, which was shapely in a voluptuous way. If she was carrying, well, perhaps another woman could tell, but the serjeant certainly could not, and the other men looked as surprised. Indeed, the owner of the lean-to stood agape, his jaw working silently for several seconds and his face assuming a purple hue, before he could find his words.</p><p>'You . . . You . . . lecherous, whoreson rogue! Ruin my daughter, would you! I'll have you whipped. Indeed, I'll do it myself.' He lunged forward, and the girl placed herself smartly between father and lover, looking not chastened but belligerent.</p><p>'Out of my way, you ungrateful wench. What your poor mother would have . . .'</p><p>'My 'poor' mother would have said I should have been wed long since, not kept to labour in her stead because you are too close-fisted to employ a woman to keep house for you. It's you who should be shamed, not I. Edwin has good prospects with Master Reginald, and is no mean match for the daughter of an idle, ale-swilling fletcher like you.' She turned to her lover. 'Will you take me dowerless, love?'</p><p>'You know that, Winflaed, but after this,' he waved his sound hand at the smouldering shop, 'I know not how we'll manage.'</p><p>Master Reginald, who had originally been contemplating the future in a very despondent fashion, seemed to have pulled himself together during the altercation over Winflaed, and now, though blackened of face and singed of brow, looked much more his normal, competent self.&nbsp;</p><p>'I'll swear not all is lost, Edwin. Whatever lies charred out the back, the flames have not done more than blacken the very front of the shop, so the ready pieces should be undamaged, and if it did not get too hot, the tools and gemstones will be there amongst the ash and soot. We can get the building repaired, even if I have to give bracelets and clasps in payment, but it'll mean a few weeks under an awning, and that's no place for a woman, especially if she is . . . Once there's proper chambers again you can bring your bride, and I'll make you my partner when your time is up next Lady Day. Let her stay with her father till all's ready.'</p><p>'As if I'd have her.' The fletcher curled his lip disdainfully. 'Giving herself like some cheap forlegnis in an alley, and behind my back too.'</p><p>Serjeant Catchpoll had been diverted by the unexpected turn of the conversation, but was keen to get back to the sheriff with a report, and now spoke up, his voice authoritative and calm.</p><p>'She’d scarce do so in front of you.' At his quip the old woman laughed, and choked as a consequence. 'You’ll take her back, Master Fletcher, with a good grace, and make efforts to give her a dower if you value your own standing. And you,' he turned on the old woman, 'will keep your tongue between the remains of your teeth and not spread gossip. Many a child arrives a mite early, and nothing is said.' He dusted his hands together, dismissing the subject. 'Now, can we get back to the fire? If you and your journeyman are certain that the fire did not start in the workshop, could it have started accidentally to the rear, with a stew pot mayhap, Master . . .?' He frowned, for Catchpoll liked to know the craftsmen of Worcester, and this one’s name eluded him for the minute.</p><p>'Reginald Ash is the name.'The silversmith gave a bitter laugh. 'Fitting, today, eh? But the fire starting from a cook-fire? No, I'd swear not. A girl comes and sets a pot cooking slow for us during the afternoon, but she don't normally do that till the bell has struck for the afternoon service in the Cathedral, and I did not hear her out back.'</p><p>'Nor I either,' agreed Edwin, 'and we weren't beating metal, nor any other noisy task.'</p><p>'Well, where would I find the girl to find out for sure?' Catchpoll could foresee the sheriff wanting to be clear about this.</p><p>'Along the way, next to Adam Merlie, the coppersmith. She's Widow Wick's daughter, Agnes.'</p><p>'And would there be anyone you know of as would want you out of business, Master Ash?'</p><p>The silversmith shook his head. 'No, none. I keeps to myself, and have no bad blood betwixt me and any man that I knows of. My goods are well made and sold for a fair price, and there has never been any complaint otherwise. No, there is no reason anyone should want to burn me out.'</p><p>Serjeant Catchpoll rubbed his grizzled chin. 'Well, I will report all this to the lord sheriff, and let him decide whether it was malice or accident.'</p><p>He left the silversmith and his man, aided no doubt by the girl Winflaed, to begin the business of clearing and salvage, and went in search of Agnes Wick. She proved an unhelpful witness. The girl was slow-witted and vague, and her mother was much inclined to speak for her or suggest what she should say. She seemed unsure as to whether she had been to the smith's, but her mother, fearing blame might come their way, swore with more vehemence than veracity that the nasty business could have nought to do with her 'poor Agnes'.</p><p>Catchpoll was left with little that he could lay before the sheriff as good evidence for accident or crime. He returned to the castle unhappily aware that William de Beauchamp would most likely leave the decision whether to investigate further up to him, and knew the blame could be laid at his door if it proved he had made the wrong choice.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still pondering his unenviable position when he entered the castle bailey, and stopped short. He had left but an hour or so previously, and all had been quiet and everyday. Now the bailey was full of bustle, with horses, men-at- arms and a noticeable number of black-habited monks.</p><p>'What in the Lady's Name is going on?' the serjeant asked of the gate guard, who was taking considerable interest in a monk's spectacularly unsuccessful attempts to get an obstinate mule into the stables.</p><p>'Well, the Brother has been trying to. . .'</p><p>'No, cabbagehead, what is all this about?' Catchpoll waved an arm at the scene within the bailey.</p><p>'Ah well, the lord Bishop of Hereford has descended upon us all, in some state, because of some dispute. All above our level I expect, Serjeant.'</p><p>'Above yours, aye, but not necessarily mine.' He did not spare the guard another glance, but made his way through the throng to the kitchens. He knew the cook well, and also knew that the cookhouse was the hub of the wheel of knowledge within the castle. Drogo the Cook seemed to know what was going on before it even happened, and Catchpoll wanted to appear before the sheriff as fully informed as possible. Experience had taught him that being abreast of the news always gave the sheriff the idea that Serjeant Catchpoll was one step ahead, and Catchpoll enjoyed that.</p><p>Drogo was shouting orders at a scullion, while waving a ladle in the manner of a battling bishop with a mace. Catchpoll grinned.</p><p>'A few more for supper then?' he quipped.</p><p>Drogo rolled his eyes. 'Ravenous wolves would be easier. Here's me, with Aelfred down with an ague, and two wenches sickening for heaven knows what, and the lord Bishop of Hereford arrives, without warning, with an army to protect him and half an abbey to pray with him. And then he sends down asking for herons! Not even just one! How much does this man eat? I thought men of God were meant to think of their souls, not their bellies! Where am I to get herons for tonight? Will they fall like manna from Heaven or does the lord bishop think there is a fresh heron stall at the gate?'</p><p>Catchpoll sympathised, as one sufficiently up the scale of hierarchy to be called upon by name and given herculean tasks to be performed instantly. His grin spread, ever more skull like.</p><p>'Give 'em chicken and say they are stunted heron, friend.'</p><p>Drogo lobbed the ladle at him, but he ducked with surprising alacrity, and it caught the spit-boy on the back of the head instead. The lad yelped.</p><p>Catchpoll put up his hands placatingly. 'Fair enough, not a good suggestion. Just tell me in a few of your well chosen words what is going on, and I'll leave you in peace.'</p><p>Drogo told him, succinctly, but with adjectives that made the girl shelling peas turn crimson. The bishop, travelling, so he said, with a large party for protection in such perilous times, had come to drag the sheriff off to the northern border of the county to sort out a land dispute where one of his holdings was involved. The sheriff would normally demur, but the thought of having the bishop and all his minions eating him out of house and home, and 'bleating' in his ear for days, swayed him.</p><p>'Well, I suppose I had best find out what the lord sheriff wants me to do, pox on it. Hope he doesn’t keep me kicking my heels for long. My wife has a nice fat partridge hanging ready to put in a pudding for tonight, and she makes a fine partridge pudding.' Catchpoll's mouth watered at the prospect.</p><p>'Puts plenty of gravy with it, I'll be bound, and not too much seasoning. Now I always say . . .'</p><p>'No time to listen to your sound cooking advice, Drogo. Must get to the lord sheriff and report.'</p><p>Before the cook could say another word, Catchpoll had gone.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>William de Beauchamp, Lord Sheriff of Worcestershire, was not a happy man. He found the society of clerics both boring and disquieting. He was a man who preferred action to pontification, and was distrustful of those who fought with clever words. He noted his serjeant's arrival in his hall with the relief of a man who sees reinforcements arriving to lift a siege, and drew him forth by an exchange of glances and a slight nod of the head. The bishop was in full flow, but the sheriff cut across him without compunction.</p><p>'You have seen Ranulf Fuller, Catchpoll? And he is content?'</p><p>'Aye, my lord. You'll have no moaning from him, leastways not more than usual, but as I returned there was a fire in the shop of Reginald Ash the silversmith.'</p><p>'Much damage?' The sheriff frowned.</p><p>'No, only to the silversmith's premises. The neighbours were quick about dealing with it, and prevented any real spread.'</p><p>The sheriff looked more cheerful. 'Good, then . . .'</p><p>'There was, my lord, some suggestion that the fire was not accidental.' Catchpoll kept his own face expressionless as the frown reappeared between the sheriff's brows, and a grimace of annoyance twisted his mouth.</p><p>'You said 'suggestion'. Is it an idle claim to keep the man's neighbours from calling down curses on him, or are there grounds for thinking it was indeed a fire that was set?’</p><p>It was Catchpoll's turn to look unhappy. His grizzled, mobile face was screwed up into an expression of contemplation, and his head nodded from side to side as he weighed the matter. This was what he had feared might happen. The sheriff was going to leave the decision on action up to him. Catchpoll far preferred being given a task, a scent to follow, and then getting on with it without interference. Making the initial judgment was, in his view, much more difficult. If he said it warranted investigation and it turned out to have been a simple mischance, the sheriff would berate him for wasting his time. Yet if it was deliberate and he ignored it, well, the consequences could be too unpleasant to contemplate. He pulled at the lobe of his left ear, meditatively, and sucked his teeth.</p><p>'It's a tricky one, my lord, honest it is. The smith and his journeyman swear the fire started in the back of the premises, not in the workshop, and definitely not at the furnace, which they say was not in use today. I thought perhaps it could be a cooking fire. A girl comes to set a pot for them in the afternoon. Trouble is, the girl is about as bright as a plough ox, if that, and I would not like to say whether what she said was true, what she thought was true, or what she thought her mother and I wanted her to say. All I would vouch for is that if the fire was lit through malice, it was not the girl that did it.'</p><p>The sheriff was no fool. He knew that Catchpoll was now trying to pass this potentially poisoned chalice back to him. His eyes narrowed for a moment, but then, to Catchpoll's surprise, he smiled; it was a small, grim smile. He was being called away by the Bishop of Hereford, and a suspicion alone was not sufficient to detain him. He cast a swift glance at the prelate, who still wore an affronted expression at having been abandoned in full flow so that the sheriff could discuss shrieval business with an underling. The smile twitched.</p><p>'Right, Serjeant. I am away north to assist the lord bishop here. In my absence you can keep your ears open in case of information that would prove this either way. I should not be gone for more than,' he paused, as the bishop made a sound between a cough and a growl, 'a week, or perhaps ten days. If there are further developments you can always send to my lord Bradecote and call him in. A little work would do my new under-sheriff no harm. The harvest is in, and his brat should have been born by now. He would probably be glad to escape cooing women and a screaming infant in his hall.'&nbsp;</p><p>With that he nodded dismissal, and Catchpoll withdrew, muttering under his breath.</p><p>He had worked once with Hugh Bradecote, the new under-sheriff, and had no real complaints about him, but he was still very green, and much inclined to get far too involved in what Catchpoll saw as his own remit. The old under-sheriff, de Crespignac, had given the sheriff’s serjeant  pretty much a free hand, and Catchpoll preferred it that way. There had been no question about his methods as long as the result was satisfactory and de Crespignac could make it sound as though the inspiration were his own. The new man wanted to be far more involved; indeed he had taken the last case with little delegation at all. Serjeant Catchpoll heaved a heavy sigh, and ambled glumly back towards the kitchens, where he slipped into the dim brewhouse, and drew himself a pot of small beer under the indulgent gaze of the florid faced, motherly woman who was busy filling pitchers for the sheriff's table. He gave her a slow, conspiratorial wink, with just enough of a leer to make her giggle and redden even further. She waddled out, still beaming, and Catchpoll, wiping the residue from his lips with the back of his hand, headed for hearth and home, and the consolation of partridge pudding.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>Copyright Sarah Hawkswood 2015</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
